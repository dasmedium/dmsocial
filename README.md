# Tetoka Education Social Network

This project is the front-end Tetoka Social Network client application.
The current live prototype of this app is hosted [here](https://radiant-reef-72314.herokuapp.com/)
Feel free to create an account and browse around.
The focus of this repo is to develop a new user interface based on [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) instead of the current live bootstrap version.

This is a nodejs application using Express as backend. Our database is a Mongo Sandbox.
Redux handles application state on the front-end.

Planned features:

- Material UI styling _in-progress_
- GraphQL integration layer
- Solidity Smart Contracts

Tetoka aims to bridge the gap between cryptographic payment networks and incentivised learning.
